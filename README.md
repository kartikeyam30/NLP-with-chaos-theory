# Sexual Predator Detection using NLP and Chaos Theory

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect sexual predators in online environments by leveraging advanced NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques and Chaos Theory. It focuses on analyzing textual data from online interactions to identify predatory behavior patterns effectively.

## Technology Stack
- Python for programming
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NLP libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy) for text processing and analysis
- TensorFlow or PyTorch for building and training NLP models
- Specific algorithms or methods inspired by Chaos Theory

## Dataset Overview
The project uses a cleaned dataset (`Cleaned_text.csv`) consisting of online chat texts. This dataset has been preprocessed to remove identifying information and ensure privacy.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed along with Pandas, NLTK/spaCy, and TensorFlow/PyTorch.
3. Install other required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage
Run the script `final.py` to start the detection process:
```bash
python final.py
```
Follow any on-screen instructions or prompts to analyze the dataset or specific text inputs for predatory behavior detection.
